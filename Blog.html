            <h2>C and C++</h2>
            <p>
                
                C is a low-level, efficient language used for system programming. C++ builds on C, adding object-oriented features for software development. Mastering both is essential for a strong programming foundation.

            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Overview
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core technologies for web development.

<br>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The backbone of any webpage, HTML structures the content with elements like headings, paragraphs, and links.

<br>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS styles the HTML elements, controlling layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual presentation to enhance user experience.

<br>JavaScript: This powerful scripting language adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites, allowing for features like animations, form validation, and real-time updates.

<br>Together, these three technologies create engaging and functional web pages, forming the foundation for modern web development.

          <h2>Learn- Java </h2>
          <p>
            Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s. Its key features include:

            <br>Platform Independence: Write once, run anywhere using the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
            <br>Object-Oriented: Promotes code reusability and organization.
            <br>Robust and Secure: Strong memory management and built-in security features.
            <br>Rich API: Extensive libraries for various applications, including web and mobile development.
            <br>Java is widely used for web applications, Android development, and enterprise solutions, making it one of the most popular programming languages today.
